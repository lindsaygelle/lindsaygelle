Hello! I'm an engineer based in Sydney, Australia 🏊‍♂️. I like robots 🤖, machine learning & artificial intelligence 🧠. Currently _1500+_ days streak @Duolingo 🇩🇪. Like me some @Nintendo. Like me some _Animal Crossing_ 🦝. Like to make things slowly 😅. I'm excited by travelling and spontenous photography 📷.
