## [@lindsaygelle](https://www.github.com/lindsaygelle) ✨

Hello! I'm an engineer hailing from Sydney, Australia 🏊‍♂️. My interests include robots 🤖, machine learning, and artificial intelligence 🧠. I'm currently learning the ropes and have a 1500+ day streak on [@Duolingo](https://www.github.com/duolingo) (German). I'm also a fan of [@Nintendo](https://www.github.com/Nintendo) and love playing Animal Crossing 🦝 and Mario Kart Tour (yes, I know it's a mobile game). I take pride in making things as neat as possible (but I guess that means I am slow to make things I like 😅). Candid photography 📷 and travel 🏞️ are my passions. As a 90's baby, I'm drawn to the 90's anime _aesthetic_. I like Fighting Games, such as _Tekken 3_, _Street Fighter 3: Third Strike_ & _Super Smash Brothers: Ultimate_.
