## [@lindsaygelle](https://www.github.com/lindsaygelle) ✨

Greetings! I'm an engineer hailing from Sydney, Australia 🏊‍♂️. My interests include robots 🤖, machine learning, and artificial intelligence 🧠. I'm currently learning the ropes and have a 1500+ day streak on @Duolingo (German). I'm also a fan of @Nintendo and love playing Animal Crossing 🦝 and Mario Kart Tour (yes, I know it's a mobile game). I take pride in making things as neat as possible 😅. Candid photography 📷 and travel are my passions. As a 90's baby, I'm drawn to the 90's anime _aesthetic_. I like Fighting Games, such as Tekken 3. But. I can't reliably input the electric wind god fist though 😿.
