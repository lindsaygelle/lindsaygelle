## [@lindsaygelle](github.com/lindsaygelle) ✨

Hello! I'm an engineer based in Sydney, Australia 🏊‍♂️. I like _robots_ 🤖, _machine learning_ & _artificial intelligence_ 🧠. Learning the ropes. Currently _1500+_ day streak [@Duolingo](github.com/duolingo) (German). Like me some [@Nintendo](github.com/nintendo). Like me some _Animal Crossing_ 🦝. Like to make things as close to neat as I can 😅. I'm excited by travelling (duh) and candid photography 📷. Love me some 90's anime aesthetic (90's born). Can't reliablly input the electric wind god fist.
